{"name":"Gqrx/fork","tagline":"Software defined radio receiver powered by GNU Radio and Qt.","body":"Gqrx\r\n====\r\n\r\nGqrx is an experimental software defined radio receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit. Currently it works on Linux and Mac and supports the following devices:\r\n- Funcube Dongle Pro and Pro+\r\n- RTL2832U-based DVB-T dongles (rtlsdr via USB and TCP)\r\n- OsmoSDR\r\n- USRP\r\n- HackRF Jawbreaker\r\n- Nuand bladeRF\r\n- any other device supported by the gr-osmosdr library\r\n\r\nGqrx can operate as a traditional AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only instrument.\r\nThis is a fork of the Gqrx program, with support for background usage, with a systray icon.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGqrx is distributed as source code package and binaries for Linux and Mac. Please see http://gqrx.dk/download for a list of official and third party download resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe first time you start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog. Supported devices that are connected to the computer are discovered automatically and you can select any of them in the drop-down list.\r\n\r\nIf you don't see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:\r\n- The driver has not included in a binary distribution\r\n- The udev rule has not been properly configured\r\n\r\nYou can test your device first with rtl_test, qthid, or uhd_usrp_probe that come with the respective packages.\r\n\r\nGqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices or if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can load a configuration from the GUI or using the -c command line argument. See \"gqrx --help\" for a complete list of command line arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown problems\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSee the bug tracker on Github: https://github.com/csete/gqrx/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting help and reporting bugs\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere is now a Google group for discussing anything related to Gqrx: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gqrx\r\nThis includes getting help with installation and troubleshooting. Please remember to provide detailed description of your problem, your setup, what steps you followed, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation from source\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe source code is hosted on Github: https://github.com/csete/gqrx\r\n\r\nTo compile gqrx from source you need the following dependencies:\r\n- GNU Radio 3.7 with the following components:\r\n    - gnuradio-runtime\r\n    - gnuradio-analog\r\n    - gnuradio-blocks\r\n    - gnuradio-filter\r\n    - gnuradio-fft\r\n    - gnuradio-audio\r\n- The gr-iqbalance library (optional)\r\n- At least one of:\r\n    - Funcube Dongle Pro driver via gnuradio-fcd\r\n    - UHD driver via gnuradio-uhd\r\n    - Funcube Dongle Pro+ driver from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus\r\n    - RTL-SDR driver from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/rtl-sdr/\r\n    - OsmoSDR driver from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/osmo-sdr/\r\n    - HackRF Jawbreaker driver from http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/\r\n- gnuradio-osmosdr from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/gr-osmosdr/\r\n- pulseaudio (Linux only and optional)\r\n- Qt 4.7 or later and optionally Qt Creator (gqrx works with Qt 5)\r\n\r\nGqrx comes with a simple qmake build setup. It can be compiled from within Qt Creator or in a terminal:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/csete/gqrx.git gqrx.git\r\n$ cd gqrx.git\r\n$ mkdir build\r\n$ cd build\r\n$ qmake ..\r\n$ make\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nTo build in debug mode add \"CONFIG+=debug\" to the qmake step above. There are also some other qmake options, see the gqrx.pro file.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits and License\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nGqrx is designed and written by Alexandru Csete OZ9AEC, and it is licensed under the GNU General Public License.\r\nSome of the source files were adopted from Cutesdr by Moe Weatley and these come with a BSD license.\r\nFollowing people and organisations have contributed:\r\n\r\nAlex Grinkov:\r\n- FM stereo demodulator.\r\n\r\nAnthony Willard:\r\n- Various fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nElias Önal:\r\n- Building Gqrx on Mac OS X.\r\n- Crash recovery dialog.\r\n\r\nFrank Brickle, AB2KT:\r\nBob McGwier, N4HY:\r\n- Noise blanker (from dttsp).\r\n\r\nGöran Weinholt, SM6-8239:\r\n- Various GUI improvements.\r\n\r\nJiří Pinkava:\r\n- Port to gnuradio 3.7 API\r\n\r\nMoe Weatley:\r\n- FFT plotter and waterfall.\r\n- Frequency selector.\r\n- Signal strength indicator.\r\n- AGC\r\n\r\nNadeem Hasan:\r\n- Bug fixes.\r\n\r\nNokia:\r\n- QtColorPicker widget.\r\n\r\nVesa Solonen:\r\n- DC removal in AM demodulator.\r\n\r\nVincent Pelletier\r\n- Initial work on the horizontal zooming / scrolling.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to Volker Schroer and Alexey Bazhin for bringing Funcube Dongle Pro+ support to GNU Radio and Gqrx.\r\n\r\nSome of the icons are from the GNOME and Tango icon themes.
